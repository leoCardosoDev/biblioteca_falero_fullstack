## **PRD Creation**

> Analyze the **app/backend** project and evaluate its compliance with **`modular-ddd-clean-arch.md`** and the **ADRs** located at `app/docs/adr`.
>
> Identify architectural divergences, implicit decisions, technical risks, and non-compliance points.
>
> For each identified issue:
>
> * Clearly describe the problem
> * Reference the affected or violated **ADR**
> * Justify why a change is required
> * Assess risks (including **breaking changes**)
> * Describe the impact per layer (**domain, application, infra, presentation, main**)
>
> Generate **only** a **PRD** using the template:
> `.agent/templates/TEMPLATE_PRD.md`
> Generate and save the file in: `app/docs/prd`
> **Do not generate task specs.**
> The goal is to define *what* must be changed and *why*, consolidating architectural decisions.
