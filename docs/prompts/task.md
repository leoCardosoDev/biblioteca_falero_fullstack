## **Task / Spec Creation**

> Based **exclusively** on the **approved PRD**, derive the implementation tasks.
>
> For each decision defined in the PRD:
>
> * Create **granular task specs**
> * Organize them by dependency impact
> * Define a safe execution order
> * Identify potential **breaking change** risks
>
> Each task must:
>
> * Address a single, clear responsibility
> * Explicitly state affected layers (**domain, application, infra, presentation, main**)
> * Include objective acceptance criteria
>
> Use the template:
> `.agent/templates/TEMPLATE_TASK_SPEC.md`
> save in `app/docs/specs/01_in_progress/backend/`
> **Do not change or reinterpret PRD decisions.**
> The goal is to define *how* to implement what has already been decided.
